# Github User Management App

The GitHub user management app is a demo project to demonstrate the ability to implement mobile apps
natively for Android & iOS by using the latest technology, architecture with **Kotlin and Compose Multiplatform**!

## üì∑ Quick Preview

- [iOS](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1foL3jDXQG2Lqxx8PFBNJA4KrazXhFPdW/view?usp=drive_link)
- [Android](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IO0A0XGOBS2gNsmJO_1AVPTXZJ9RlCWZ/view?usp=drive_link )

## üîß Installation

1. Clone this repository:  `git clone https://github.com/trexnguyen28/github-user-management`
2. Open in the latest version of Android Studio or Intellij idea.
3. Before running the project, obtain an Github API token
   from [Github](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) .
4. Change `const val API_TOKEN = ""` by your token
5. For Android, run the `composeApp` module by selecting the `app` configuration. If you need help
   with the configuration, follow this link
   for [android](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/compose-multiplatform-create-first-app.html#run-your-application-on-android)
6. For iOS, run the `composeApp` module by selecting the `iosApp` configuration. If you need help
   with the configuration, follow this link
   for [Ios](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/compose-multiplatform-create-first-app.html#run-your-application-on-ios)

## üßëüèª‚Äçüíª Tech stack

- Application entirely written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org)
- UI developed entirely
  in [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/)
- UI Tests
  with [Compose Multiplatform UI Testing](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/compose-test.html)
- Component-based navigation with [Voyager](https://voyager.adriel.cafe/)
- Dependency injection with [Koin](https://insert-koin.io)
- Network request with [Ktor Client](https://github.com/ktorio/ktor)
- Data store persistence (Offline mode)
  with [Kotlin DataStore](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/multiplatform/datastore)
- Image caching with [Coil](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/)

## üìñ Project Struture

Let's take a look in project structure inside the **commonMain** folder:

* **ui** - The folder containing all the UI components and their View Model for whole application.
  Currently we have `MainScreen` and `DetailScreen`.
* **di** - The folder containing all DI module follwing the _dependency  
  inversion_ concept by **Koin**. Currently we
  have `networkModule` , `dataModule` `viewModelMoudle`.
* **data** - The folder containing the data definition and their handling logic
  including `model`, `repository`, `cachingStore`
* **client** - The folder containing the handling logic related to networking requests such
  as `GithubUserClient`
* **utitls** - The foloder containing the helpers, utils logic

## üèõ App Architecture

The app architecture is based on
the [MVVM](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) architecture
officially supported by Android developer community. We also relies on some core principles such
as [SOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns), [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle),
and [Clean architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)

To better represents the idea behind the screse, here is a architecture image representing the flow:

## ü§ù Caveat

For demo purposes in the short time, features in this app have **not** been fully tested yet and
there are many things we need to enhance:

* Refreshing state for list loading.
* Network error handling UI such as Toast or pop-up.
* Unit test / instrument test with higher coverage.
* [SQLight](https://github.com/cashapp/sqldelight) as the app local database for better performance
  and scaling.
* [Decompose](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose) as the fully component based navigation
  approach.
